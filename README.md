This is the code space for paper "Does Location Really Matter? The Dominant Role of Temporal Features in Predicting Smoking Events".

Due to the data privacy limit, we could not directly share our raw data in our study. So we create a synthetic datatable named `synthetic_raw_data.csv`, including all the necessary columns and other structure needed for our methods implementation. 

We showed the detailed sample usage of our processing data, doing correlation analysis, building logistic regression, and saving model results within the jupyter notebook `data_processing_modeling.ipynb`.
